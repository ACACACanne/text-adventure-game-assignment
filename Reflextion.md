Developer Reflection: The Haunted Academy

Project Goals
This project began as a creative way to explore OOP principles while blending academic stress with horror storytelling. My goal was to build a modular, scalable game that felt emotionally engaging and technically sound.

What I Learned
- Refactoring with classes helped me understand encapsulation and reusability
- Implementing command parsing deepened my logic structuring
- Designing spooky transitions and sound effects taught me how to layer user experience
- Accessibility and responsive design remain central to my development values

Challenges
- Balancing narrative flow with game logic
- Debugging command handling and room transitions
- Creating immersive effects without overwhelming the UI

Final Thoughts
This game reflects my passion for storytelling through code. Itâ€™s a space where creativity meets structure, and where every bug becomes part of the lore.
